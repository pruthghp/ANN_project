# ANN project
•	A Neural Network model that can detect, identify, and categorize flowers into its classes by extracting all the crucial features and characteristics from the image and correlating it with the dataset. 
•	Uses Resnet-9 Architecture with an enhanced ReLu activation function that uses batch-wise training and processing technique allowing the model to learn and improve by itself to provide better results.
